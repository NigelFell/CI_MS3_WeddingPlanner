#

## Project Scope

    To build a website for two users to play a Four in a Line game, taking turns to drop counters and so competing against each other to line up four counters in a column, row or diagonal arrangement.

    The website will indicate which players turn it is next, check and display if there has been a winner, display the players score in games won, allow the players to reset the board so starting a new game and display the rules and objective of the game.

#

## Future Enhancements

    1. Allow one user to compete against the website at different levels of skill.

    2. Allow two users to compete against each other but on different devices in different locations.

#

## User Experience (UX)

-    ### User stories

    -   First Time Visitor Goals:
        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily play the Four in a Line game in a  
           clear presentation that is responsive on different devices.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to view how to play and the objective of the 
           game.
        4. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to view current scores.
        5. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to see who's turn it is next.
        6. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to see see the winner.
        7. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to reset the game and start a new one.
        
    -   Returning & Frequent Visitor Goals:
        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to quickly access the site and play the Four in a Line game as per the first time visitor.

-   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        To create a modern look and feel that is clear to new users and familiar to a user who has played the physical version of the Four in a Line game.

    -   #### Typography
        Raleway is the font used on the site. Sans Serif is the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The Raleway font is an elegant sans-serif typeface.

    -   #### Imagery
        Imagery is important but has been kept to a minimum to improve the sites upload time.

    -   #### Sound
        Sound effects enhance the user experience with extra feedback on their actions.

-   ### Initial Coding

    -   The site was coded in Gitpod alongside the "Love Maths" project and therefore takes some of    
        the features and code from this resource.

-   ### Responsiveness

    -   The site was initially checked with Google Chrome's Dev Tools using the Device Toolbar to 
        check different device sizes, [screenshots below in test section.](#TestResp)

    -   The site was then run on a Nokia 3.1 mobile phone running Andriod version 10 with good results

#

## Features

-   Responsive on all device sizes
-   Interactive elements
-   Interactive front-end that responds to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with 
    data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

        5. There are tooltips on the who's turn it is textbox and new game button to assist the user.
        6. The user can easily see instructions on how to play and the rules of the game.
        7. The user is alerted with a popup if they click a column that is full, if they carry on playing after a winner has been declared or if they click the new game button when the game is still in play.

       presentation that is responsive on different devices.
        1. The site has been designed to be easy to use and allow the user to concentrate on the game 
           using different devices such as a standard computer, laptop, tablet or mobile phone.

        3. If the counter dropped is a winner the user is notified in the highlighted text box above the game table. 
    
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to view how to play and the objective of the game.
        1. The user can easily find a description of the rules and objective of the game in a rules 
           section.

        2. If the game is still in play a confirm popup is shown to the user.

-   #### Returning & Frequent Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to quickly access the site and play the Four in a Line game as per 
       the first time visitor.
        1. The user can access the site quickly and start playing a new game as they are familiar with the rules and intuitive game design.

### Testing The Check For A Winner Algorithm

-   #### Algorithm Design

    The algorithm design follows a methodical approach, checking for a winner in the just dropped counters column, then row, then diagonal going right and finally diagonal going left. The testing followed this same approach with test scenarios to cover each eventuality.

-   #### Test Scenarios Performed

    1. Tests for win in column:
        1. Test for win in first column from bottom row up four counters, top row down four counters and then the middle four rows.
        2. Test for win in last column from bottom row up four counters, top row down four counters and then the middle four rows.
        3. Test for win in a middle column from bottom row up four counters, top row down four counters and then the middle four rows.

    2. Tests for win in row:
        1. Test for win in bottom row from first column across four counters, last column back across four counters and then in the middle columns across four counters.
        2. Test for win in top row from first column across four counters, last column back across four counters and then in the middle columns across four counters.
        3. Test for win in a middle row from first column across four counters, last column back across four counters and then in the middle columns across four counters.

    3. Tests for win diagonal going left to right:
        1. Test for win from bottom row first column diagonally across and then a middle column diagonally across.
        2. Test for win from top row diagonally back from the last column and then diagonally back from a middle column.
        3. Test for win from a middle row first column diagonally across and then a middle column diagonally across.
        4. Test for win from a middle row diagonally back from the last column and then diagonally back from a middle column.

    4. Tests for win diagonal going right to left:
        1. Test for win from bottom row last column diagonally back across and then a middle column diagonally back across.
        2. Test for win from top row diagonally across from the first column and then diagonally back from a middle column.
        3. Test for win from a middle row first column diagonally back across and then a middle column diagonally back across.
        4. Test for win from a middle row diagonally back from the last column and then diagonally back from a middle column.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Opera browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone 6 and various Window 
    phones.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site on as many devices as they had available, 
    play the game and to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   No known bugs at this time!
